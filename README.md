### Hi there, I'm Marcel Cleres - I'm a control and automation engineering student with a focus on Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Data Science.

- Currently enrolled in the Ada Tech - Data Science program, I am working on my thesis using instance segmentation with a Mask R-CNN and Siamese neural network. I aim to gain experience in creating and deploying classical machine learning, computer vision, and NLP models. My goal is to become an MLOps engineer in the future.


## In this GitHub you will find:

- Machine learning projects related to control engineering problems
- Projects involving classical machine learning for data
- ADA tech classes
- Vision model building tests, experiments with PyTorch, TensorFlow
- Model deployment tests

I intend to keep updating as the projects are completed. Please be patient!
