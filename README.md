# Hi there, I'm Marcel Cleres - I'm a control and automation engineering student with a focus on Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Data Science.  My goal is to become an MLOps engineer in the future.

## üõ†Ô∏è I have experience with SQL, machine learning, computer vision (Detection and segmentation). I am currently studying NLP and LLMs, along with system integration using Hugging Face, MLflow, Streamlit, among others.


## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies and Tools

- **Data Analysis:**  Python (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy), Databricks (learning), SQL
- **Machine learning:** Supervised learning (regression, classification, random forests, SVM, boosting, KNN), Unsupervised learning (DBSCAN, PCA, t-SNE, K-means), MLP, RNN 
- **Computer vision** Keras, PyTorch, TensorFlow, OpenCV, YOLO, Mask R-CNN, metric learning, deep metric learning, transfer learning, CNN. 
- **Methodologies** √Ågil (Scrum, Kanban)  
- **Deploy/integration** Streamlit, Gradio, Hugging Face, MCP (learning)
- **Cloud** - AWS, AZUREML, Google Cloud Plataform.


## In this GitHub you will find:

- Machine learning projects related to control engineering problems
- Projects involving classical machine learning for data
- Courses and projects from the ADA Tech program
- Vision model building tests, experiments with PyTorch, TensorFlow
- Model deployment tests
